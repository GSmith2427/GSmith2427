- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GSmith2427 or Gabe :)
- I am currently a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Nottingham due to graduate in 2027.
- My current educational path is to prepare me for working with embedded systems and I am actively looking for internships, whether it be summer or industry placements.
- My favourite languages are python and C#, but currently I am also experimenting with C and Assembly for my 1st year modules. With these skills I hope to refine and use it to lay a foundation in my career as an embeeded sys engineer.
- My extracurricular interests are, going to the gym, rock climbing, combat sports, formula and robotics.
- Feel free to have a look at my previous work completed as personal projects as well as from prior education projects.
